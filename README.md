I.	***Introduction***

A **fast food restaurant**, also known as a **quick service restaurant (QSR)** within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant that serves fast food cuisine and has minimal table service. The food served in fast food restaurants is typically part of a "meat-sweet diet", offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided. 

The restaurant is increasing in term of the demand, and as a consequent, is increasing in revenue. Predicting the restaurant revenue for the future is crucial for me as I am determinate and motivated in doing so. This analysis will help me to know more about the future revenue of the restaurant.
